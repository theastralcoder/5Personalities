        <br>
        <p>Trait theories of personality have long attempted to pin down exactly how many traits exist. Earlier theories
            have suggested various numbers. For instance, Gordon Allport's list contained 4,000 personality traits,
            Raymond Cattell had 16 personality factors, and Hans Eysenck offered a three-factor theory.

            Many researchers felt that Cattell's theory was too complicated and Eysenck's was too limited in scope. As a
            result, the Big 5 personality traits emerged and are used to describe the broad traits that serve as
            building blocks of personality.

            Many contemporary personality psychologists believe that there are five basic dimensions of personality,
            often referred to as the "Big 5" personality traits. These five primary personality traits are extraversion
            (also often spelled extroversion), agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.

            Extraversion is sociability, agreeableness is kindness, openness is creativity and intrigue,
            conscientiousness is thoughtfulness, and neuroticism often involves sadness or emotional instability.

        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            It is important to note that each of the five primary personality traits represents a range between two
            extremes. For example, extraversion represents a continuum between extreme extraversion and extreme
            introversion. In the real world, most people lie somewhere in between.

            While there is a significant body of literature supporting these primary personality traits, researchers
            don't always agree on the exact labels for each dimension.

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Openness</b> <br>
            Openness (also referred to as openness to experience) emphasizes imagination and insight the most out of all
            five personality traits. People who are high in openness tend to have a broad range of interests. They are
            curious about the world and other people and are eager to learn new things and enjoy new experiences.

            People who are high in this personality trait also tend to be more adventurous and creative. Conversely,
            people low in this personality trait are often much more traditional and may struggle with abstract
            thinking.

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Conscientiousness</b> <br>
            Among each of the personality traits, conscientiousness is one defined by high levels of thoughtfulness,
            good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviors. Highly conscientious people tend to be organized and
            mindful of details. They plan ahead, think about how their behavior affects others, and are mindful of
            deadlines.

            Someone scoring lower in this primary personality trait is less structured and less organized. They may
            procrastinate to get things done, sometimes missing deadlines completely.

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Extraversion</b> <br>
            Extraversion (or extroversion) is a personality trait characterized by excitability, sociability,
            talkativeness, assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness. People high in extraversion are
            outgoing and tend to gain energy in social situations. Being around others helps them feel energized and
            excited.

            People who are low in this personality trait or introverted tend to be more reserved. They have less energy
            to expend in social settings and social events can feel draining. Introverts often require a period of
            solitude and quiet in order to "recharge."
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Agreeableness</b> <br>
            This personality trait includes attributes such as trust, altruism, kindness, affection, and other prosocial
            behaviors. People who are high in agreeableness tend to be more cooperative while those low in this
            personality trait tend to be more competitive and sometimes even manipulative.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Neuroticism</b> <br>
            Neuroticism is a personality trait characterized by sadness, moodiness, and emotional instability.
            Individuals who are high in neuroticism tend to experience mood swings, anxiety, irritability, and sadness.
            Those low in this personality trait tend to be more stable and emotionally resilient.
